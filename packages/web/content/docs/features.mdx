## Multi‑provider in one interface

Arctic keeps all your coding plan providers in one place so you can switch models without switching tools.

## Usage limits in one view

Arctic aggregates limits and credits across providers, including rolling windows like 5‑hour and weekly limits.

## Statistics and activity tracking

Track your AI coding activity with GitHub-style heatmaps, cost breakdowns, and model usage statistics. See your streaks, peak coding hours, and token consumption over time.

## TUI focused on flow

The terminal UI is built for speed:

- Session list and navigation
- Model and agent pickers
- Copy/selection tooling
- Command palette

## Agents and commands

Define custom agents and command templates to standardize workflows across projects.

## Tools with permissions

Tools are permission‑gated (bash, read/write/edit, webfetch, etc.) so automation stays controlled.

## Snapshots and diffing

Git‑based snapshots power safe undo/revert and benchmarking workflows.
