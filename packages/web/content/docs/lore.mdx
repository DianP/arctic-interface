## Why this fork exists

I tried OpenCode because the CLI experience was solid, but a few things didn’t click for me:

- The sidebar wasn’t collapsible
- Selection always copied everything
- I couldn’t connect multiple coding plan providers (Codex, Gemini, Antigravity)
- And most importantly, I couldn’t see coding‑plan usage in one place

So I forked it.

## The goal

I use Codex, Z.ai, Claude Code, Gemini, and Antigravity. I wanted a single CLI that lets me:

- run all of them from one place
- see 5‑hour and weekly limits together
- keep a consistent workflow regardless of provider
